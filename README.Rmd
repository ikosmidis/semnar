# semnar <img src="https://github.com/ikosmidis/semnar/blob/develop/inst/art/semnar_hex.svg" width="320" align="right">

[**semnar**](https://github.com/ikosmidis/semnar) provides methods for constructing and maintaining a database of presentations in R. The presentations are either ones that the user gives or gave or presentations at a particular event or event series. [**semnar**](https://github.com/ikosmidis/semnar) also provides methods for the interactive mapping of the presentations using `leaflet` by grouping them according to country, city, year and other presentation attributes (see `?plot.semnar`). The markers on the map come with popups providing presentation details (title, institution, event, links to materials and events, and so on).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ikosmidis/semnar")
```
and the released version with:
```r
install.packages("semnar")
```

## Presentation databases

`add_presentation` is the main function for constructing and maintaining a data base of presentations. For example, below I record the details of a recent presentation I gave to the PhD students and PostDocs at University of Warwick on workflows and task management. 
```{r}
library("semnar")
YRM <- event(event = "Young Researchers' Meeting",
             country = "England",
             city = "Coventry",
             lon = -1.560843, lat = 52.384019,
             link = "https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/news/yrm/",
             institution = "University of Warwick",
             department = "Department of Statistics",
             venue = "Mathematical Sciences Building")

IK <- presenter(name = "Ioannis", surname = "Kosmidis",
                affiliation = "University of Warwick",
                email = "ioannis.kosmidis@warwick.ac.uk",
                link = "https://ikosmidis.com")

IK_talks <- add_presentation(presenter = IK,
                             title = "A workflow that most probably isn't yours",
                             type = "presentation",
                             event = YRM,
                             room = "M1.02",
                             materials = "https://ikosmidis.com/files/ikosmidis_YRM_2019.pdf",
                             start = "29 May 2019 4pm",
                             end = "29 May 2019, 17:00")
```
Here, I start by defining the event information using `event()`, the presenter information using `presenter()`, and then supply the resulting objects in an `add_presentation()` call along with other presentation-specific details. `add_presentation` also provides arguments for supplying the same event and presenter information (and much more; see `?add_presentation`), but using the `event()` and `presenter()` constructor is useful when there are many presentations in the same event, and/or many presentations by the same presenter.

`IK_talks` is now a structured `data.frame` that also inherits from class `semnar`, including the supplied presentation details.
```{r}
str(IK_talks)
```

I can then add another presentation, conveniently, by piping `IK_talks` forward into `add_presentation` using the pipe operator `|>`:
```{r}
IK_talks <- IK_talks |>
    add_presentation(presenter = IK,
                     country = "United States",
                     city = "Stanford",
                     lon = -122.165330, lat = 37.429464,
                     event = "useR! 2016",
                     title = "brglm: Reduced-bias inference in generalized linear models",
                     link = "https://user2016.r-project.org//files/abs-book.pdf",
                     materials = "https://bit.ly/2KCBbKg",
                     type = "presentation", 
                     venue = "Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research",
                     room = "Siepr 120",
                     start = "20160629 14:15", end = "20160629 14:35")
```
`start` and `end` are parsed using the [**parsedate**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=parsedate) R package, which allows for great flexibility in the format that dates/times are supplied.



## Mapping
The details in the database can be mapped using [**leaflet**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(IK_talks, group = "city",
     title = "<a href='https://cran.r-project.org/package=semnar'>semnar</a> map")
```

See `?plot.semnar` for the customization options `plot.semnar` provides, and [my talks page](https://ikosmidis.com/talks) for a live version with talks I gave in the last few years...

## Interaction with other tools
`jsonlite` can be directly used to export the [**semnar**](https://github.com/ikosmidis/semnar) databases into json files, ready to use in other software:
```{r}
library("jsonlite")
toJSON(IK_talks)
```
