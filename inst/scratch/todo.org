+ Check whether the supplied countryname exists
+ Have a `presenter` function which can then be appended to a `seminaR object`

The presenter object will have attributes

name, surname, department, affiliation, email

The idea is that more than one presenters can be added dynamically,
i.e. when a presenter is appended to a seminar object the necessary
number of presenters is added appending the column names with _1, _2
and so on

adding presenters will be destructive in the sense that all past
presenters are overwritten by adding presenters

The necessary structure are similar to what is done in trackeR for changing units.
