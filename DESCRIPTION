Description: provides methods for constructing and maintaining a list of seminars or talks in R. The presentations are either ones that the user gives or gave or a list of talks at a particular event or event series. The package also provides methods for the interactive mapping of the presentations using `leaflet` by grouping them according to country, city, year and other presentation attributes (see `?plot.semnar`). The markers on the map come with popups providing presentation details (title, insitution, event and so on) and materials (links to materials and events).
