\title{Guess presentation address in a \code{"semnar"} object using OSM's API for reverse geocoding}
\usage{
\method{guess_address}{semnar}(object, all = FALSE)

guess_address(object, all = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{"semnar"}. See \code{\link{add_presentation}}.}

\item{all}{should we be guessing all addresses (\code{TRUE}) or only missing ones (\code{FALSE}; default)?}

\description{
Guess presentation address in a \code{"semnar"} object using OSM's API for reverse geocoding
}
\details{
\code{guess_address} is using reverse geocoding through the API at
\url{https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org}. Please check at that
